Readme File for Warmup 1

Completed on 13 March 2019

Description
===========
The purpose of this project is to analyze five players from the Golden State Warriors (Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green) from the 2016 season. Summary statistics, shot charts, and effective shooting charts were created to desribe how each player did and how they played during this season.


File Structure
==============
The project is split into several folders: code, data, images, output, and report. In the code folder, there are scripts that were used to create shots-data.csv and all the shot charts. The data folder contains the raw data, shots-data.csv (which combines all the raw data), and a data dictionary. The images folder contains all the shot charts, the basketball court template, and a picture of the players. The output folder contains all the summary statistics, and the report folder contains the final report.


Motivation
==========
The Golden State Warriors are a strong team in the NBA already, but I wanted to find whether there were some aspects where they could improve.
