### Apple Sharlotka

![Apple Sharlotka](https://azcookbook.com/storage/2009/10/apple-sharlotka-cake02.jpg)

**Ingredients**

-   6 large, tart apples, such as Granny Smiths
-   3 large eggs
-   1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour
-   Ground cinnamon, *to finish*
-   Powdered sugar, *also to finish*

**Kitchen Tools**

-   greasing pan
-   oven

**Directions**

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2.  Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper.
3.  Butter the paper and the sides of the pan.
4.  Peel, halve and core your apples, then chop them into medium-sized chunks.
5.  Pile the cut apples directly in the prepared pan. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, using an electric mixer or whisk, beat eggs with sugar until thick and ribbons form on the surface of the beaten eggs.
6.  Beat in vanilla, then stir in flour with a spoon until just combined. The batter will be very thick.
7.  Pour over apples in pan, using a spoon or spatula to spread the batter so that it covers all exposed apples.
8.  Bake in preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a tester comes out free of batter.
9.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes on rack, then flip out onto another rack, peel off the parchment paper, and flip it back onto a serving platter.
10. Dust lightly with ground cinnamon and serve.

Great for dessert or snack any season of the year! Add more cinnamon if desired!

Euclidean Distance
==================

Definition
----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\bf{\\overline{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>)) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$||{\\bf p}||= \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\cdots+ p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{{\\bf p} \\cdot {\\bf p}} $$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
